    <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
	<h3>
    <p>I started programming at age 9, beginning with JavaScript and Scratch. A few years later I was working in Unity with C#, and continued to further my education through camps and classes while in highschool. While studying at the Academy of Interactive Entertainement Seattle, I have developed an in depth understanding of Unreal and Unity engines, associated languages, and networking for games. Since graduating I have continued my passion with various personal projects that have furthered my mastery of game development and programming.</p>
	<p>My experience includes working with C#, C++, and C, particularly in game development and low-level programming. I’m always looking to expand my skills, take on new challenges, and refine my approach to problem-solving across different areas of development.</p>
    <p>Beyond game programming, I’ve also developed a strong interest in electronics and robotics, working with hardware, and integrating software with physical systems. </p>
	<p>For fun, I love flying FPV drones, playing Counter-Strike, as well as skateboarding.</p>
