<section class="about">
    <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
    <p>I started programming at a young age, beginning with basic web development and node-based programming. Over time, I got into game development, working with Unity by fifth grade and continuing to learn through middle and high school. I took multiple programming courses and supplemented my education with independent study and hands-on projects.</p>
    
    <p>Beyond game programming, I’ve also developed a strong interest in electronics and robotics, working with hardware, designing circuits, and integrating software with physical systems. More recently, I’ve been exploring network programming and learning how different systems communicate over networks. My experience includes working with C#, C++, and C, particularly in game development and low-level programming. I’m always looking to expand my skills, take on new challenges, and refine my approach to problem-solving across different areas of development.</p>
	
	<p>For fun, I love flying/buidling FPV drones, 3D printing and robotics, as well as skateboarding.</p>
