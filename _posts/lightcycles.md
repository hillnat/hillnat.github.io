Project Simple Jet was a small demo project I used to test my understanding of the Unity engine's physics system. Force based throttle, lift, drag, and rotation where used to acheive a semi realistic flight model. 

In the process of this project I gained a better understanding of rigidbody physics, quaternions, and game engine colliders.
