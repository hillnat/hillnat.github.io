FPV Sim is a multiplayer flight simulator designed to train FPV drone pilots in freestyle and racing scenarios. This project offers multiple freestyle maps and race courses, allowing players to refine their skills and compete for the best lap times.
The core objective is to provide extensive customization over drone physics and tuning, delivering a realistic and adaptable experience suited to individual user preferences.
Additionally, FPV Sim supports a wide range of radio transmitters and gamepads, ensuring accessibility across different control methods. Designed to be lightweight, the simulator runs efficiently even on low-spec machines without dedicated GPUs.
