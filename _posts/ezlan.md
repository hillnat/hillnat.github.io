## Involvement
> As the sole programmer on the team, that was my primary focus. One of the designers (Bryan Martin) was able to do some minor programming tasks with guidance which took off some of the workload. With the extra time, I provided the team with my engine knowledge for better implimentations, and headed source control fixing merge errors and keeping everyone on track with the latest version.

> Through this project I was not only able to practice various game programming skills, but was also able to test my ablility to work with a team and in a time contraint.
