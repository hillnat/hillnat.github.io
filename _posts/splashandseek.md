Splash and Seek: Bear vs Fish is an asymmetrical multiplayer hide-and-seek game set in a vibrant water park, where players take on the roles of a seeker Bear and hiding Fish. With its unique blend of stealth, strategy, and environment interaction, the game offers a fresh and engaging multiplayer experience that promotes teamwork, social interaction, and thrilling gameplay.

As part of the 2024 Minor Production held by AIE Seattle for its students, I got to work as lead programmer in a simulated production environment. Along with making general gameplay systems I got to farther explore Unity URP in making a custom render feature for the games screen space outlines, Shader Graph to make toon and water shaders, and VFX Graph for various particles.

It was an interesting experience working with a bigger team and on a longer term project than I have in the past. This experience makes me look forward to Major Production in 2025 and future projects.
