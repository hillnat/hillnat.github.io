	<h2>OpenGL Render Engine</h2>
	<p>
	<blockquote>
	<p>This custom game engine features OpenGL rendering, custom physics, and a comprehensive gameobject based structure serving as an effecient baseline for 3D games built in C++.<br><br>For me, this project was a deep dive into data structures and rendering techniques. Becoming familiar with OpenGL and associated libraries strengthened my ability as a game developer to make games outside of any existing engine.

	<h2>EzLAN</h2>
	<p>
	<blockquote>
	<p>EzLAN is a local networking backend built as a plugin for Unity. EzLAN allows a plug-and-play solution to networking of gameobjects for basic applications.<br><br>For this project I took a deep dive into WebSock2, with the goal of understanding how networking was done 'back in the day' before more streamlines alternatives became available. Writing network code on a low level is an eye openining experience to understand how game engines can network objects effeciently and at a large scale.
