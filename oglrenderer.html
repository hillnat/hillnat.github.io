        <h2>Custom Engine [C++, OpenGL]</h2>
        <p>This custom game engine was built for a AIE school project. This engine features OpenGL rendering, and a custom physics implementation, all in a game engine structure. Written purely in C++ with GLSL, the objective of the project was to push my skills as a programmer, and fully understand the process of developing a game engine.</p>

<p class="project-description">This custom game engine was built for a AIE school project. This engine features OpenGL rendering, and a custom physics implementation, all in a game engine structure. Written purely in C++ and GLSL, the objective of the project was to push my skills as a programmer, and fully understand the process of developing a game engine.</p>
<p class = "project-description">This project utilizes OpenGL, GLFW, GLEW, GLM, and ASSIMP for interfacing with the Windows API, math, asset loading, and much more.</p> 
<p class="project-description">This project was truly eye opening to me into the way graphics cards render meshes. From manually writing out meshes in C++ to developing a basic understanding of software such as Blender, my understanding of 3D graphics was greatly improved</p>
<p class="project-description">In addition, this project is fully documented using DoxyGen, providing cohesive notes for anyone who wishing to expand upon this project.</p>
